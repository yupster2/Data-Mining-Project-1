We chose to analyze a data set containing Crypto Currency trading data for 1,337 "Cryptos". We were interested in the data set due to the popularity of Crypto Currencies such as Bitcoin, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash and others. Given the recent volatility in the market, we thought it would be interesting to analyze Open, High and Closing Prices, while trying to determine if there is a correlation between Price and relative rank of the currencies. We will run a Principal Component Analysis to determine if we can reduce our variables. We will measure the effectiveness of our algorithm by determining the percent of the variation explained by our Principal Components. We will use a "train set" of data, using the Buy Flag as our target.
